#<font color="#20e020">HI removed, cleaned

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,207
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,833
Myrcella?

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,000
Myrcella?

5
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,207
Kill us!

6
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:44,165
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

7
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,875
Please try not to scream.

8
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,374
This is Brandon Stark.

9
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,374
Son of Ned Stark.

10
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,207
Let's get them inside.

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,874
For decades,
House Lannister

12
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,583
has been
the true power in Westeros,

13
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,623
and the feat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

14
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:05,040
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

15
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,082
and take it.

16
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:07,583
Summon Jon Snow.

17
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,374
He would make
a valuable ally.

18
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,081
Let him stand before you
and tell you the things

19
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:13,124
that have happened to him.

20
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,374
Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

21
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:20,207
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

22
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,374
We need allies.

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,248
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

24
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:27,916
Until I return,
the North is yours.

25
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,249
The bastard
of Winterfell.

26
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,666
The dwarf
of Casterly Rock.

27
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,040
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

28
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,957
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

29
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,415
Picked up some scars
along the road.

30
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,916
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

31
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,415
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

32
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:33,248
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

33
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:36,331
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

34
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,915
Unluckily for me.

35
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,958
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

36
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,331
Welcome to Dragonstone.

37
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,165
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

38
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,540
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

39
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,291
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

40
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,291
Of course.

41
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,458
Please, this way.

42
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,790
Where are you from?

43
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,081
I can't place the accent.

44
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,915
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

45
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,999
Ah. I hear it's
beautiful down there.

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,081
Palm trees
and butterflies.

47
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,499
Haven't been, myself.

48
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,458
This place has changed.

49
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,957
- And Sansa?
- I hear she's alive and well.

50
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,458
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

51
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:07,040
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

52
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,206
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

53
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,123
Anyway...

54
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:14,957
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

55
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,331
She's starting to let on.

56
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,248
Good.

57
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,290
At some point,

58
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:24,248
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

59
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,040
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

60
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,832
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

61
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,957
A long and bloody tale.

62
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,708
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

63
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,874
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

64
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,290
Of course they do.

65
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,000
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

66
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:47,540
General rule of thumb...

67
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,665
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

68
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,415
True...

69
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,541
but I'm not a Stark.

70
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,041
I'd say you get
used to them...

71
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,249
but you never really do.

72
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,041
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

73
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,999
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,999
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,457
Don't you want
to see him again?

76
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,081
I've done my part.

77
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,498
I've brought
ice and fire together.

78
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,790
Strange.

79
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,290
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

80
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,957
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

81
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,331
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

82
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:02,540
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

83
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,957
Oh, I doubt that.

84
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,582
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

85
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,415
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

86
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,665
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

87
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,916
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

88
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,832
I did not part
on good terms

89
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,832
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

90
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,666
Why?

91
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,541
Because of
mistakes I made.

92
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,541
Terrible mistakes.

93
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:37,498
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

94
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,707
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

95
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,707
Good.

96
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,957
If you don't mind
my saying,

97
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,707
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

98
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,166
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

99
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:55,290
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

100
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,081
- One last time.
- My lady...

101
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:00,665
I have to die
in this strange country.

102
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,499
Just like you.

103
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,373
You stand in the presence

104
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:49,165
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

105
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,373
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

106
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,331
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

107
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,749
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

108
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,457
the Mother of Dragons,

109
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,665
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

110
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,458
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

111
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,249
This is Jon Snow.

112
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,041
He's King in the North.

113
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,915
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

114
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,165
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

115
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,749
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

116
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,749
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

117
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,623
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

118
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,457
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me...

119
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,707
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

120
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,623
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

121
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:41,248
I never did receive
a formal education,

122
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,582
but I could have
sworn I read

123
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,874
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

124
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,040
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

125
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,248
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

126
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:57,290
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

127
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,790
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

128
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,123
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

129
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:03,540
No, of course not.

130
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,123
But still,
an oath is an oath.

131
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,540
And perpetuity means...

132
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,999
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,498
Forever.

134
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,582
Forever.

135
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,415
So I assume, my lord...

136
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,624
...you're here
to bend the knee.

137
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,708
I am not.

138
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:26,832
Oh.

139
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,666
Well, that is
unfortunate.

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,665
You've traveled
all this way

141
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,832
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

142
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,331
Break faith?

143
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,665
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

144
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,373
He burned my uncle alive.

145
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:41,707
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms...

146
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,791
My father...
was an evil man.

147
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,833
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

148
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:51,707
I ask your forgiveness

149
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,665
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

150
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,540
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

151
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,916
by the sins
of her father.

152
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:04,874
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

153
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,749
and those were
the best centuries

154
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,874
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

155
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,373
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

156
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:14,206
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

157
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,206
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

158
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:21,957
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

159
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,373
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

160
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:28,040
Bend the knee and I will name
you Warden of the North.

161
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,248
Together, we will
save this country

162
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,875
from those
who would destroy it.

163
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,749
You're right.

164
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,248
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

165
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:52,081
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

166
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,081
Then why are you here?

167
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:56,916
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

168
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,081
Did you see three dragons

169
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,040
flying overhead
when you arrived?

170
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,123
I did.

171
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:07,415
And did you see
the Dothraki,

172
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,623
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

173
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,582
They're hard to miss.

174
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,623
But still, I need your help?
Not to defeat Cersei.

175
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:18,957
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

176
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,206
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

177
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:25,331
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

178
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,957
Why not?

179
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,665
The only reason I can see

180
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,915
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

181
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,957
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

182
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,790
but you won't do it,

183
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,999
which means,
at the very least,

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,458
you're better
than Cersei.

185
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,332
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

186
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:50,832
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

187
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,457
we're children
playing at a game,

188
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,540
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

189
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,665
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

190
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,165
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

191
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,040
he's refused to bow, and now
he's calling me a child.

192
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,832
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

193
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,165
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

194
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,331
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

195
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,999
As far as I can see, you are
the enemy to the north.

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,666
I am not your enemy.

197
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,999
The dead are the enemy.

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,541
The dead?

199
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,415
Is that another
figure of speech?

200
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,040
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

201
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,123
The Army of the Dead?

202
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,290
You don't know me
well, my lord,

203
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,623
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

204
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,165
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

205
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,290
The Army of the Dead
is real.

206
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,749
The white walkers
are real.

207
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,665
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

208
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,206
If they get past the Wall

209
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,708
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

210
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,332
we're finished.

211
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,207
I was born
at Dragonstone.

212
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,540
Not that I can
remember it.

213
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,999
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,206
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

215
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:14,040
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

216
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,583
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

217
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,958
Not that it matters now,
of course.

218
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,040
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

219
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,415
So many men
have tried to kill me,

220
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,915
I don't remember
all their names.

221
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,999
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,540
I've been chained
and betrayed,

223
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,331
raped and defiled.

224
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,582
Do you know
what kept me standing

225
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,540
through all those years
in exile?

226
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,498
Faith.

227
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,749
Not in any gods,

228
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,290
not in myths and legends.

229
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,915
In myself.

230
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,081
In Daenerys Targaryen.

231
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:04,623
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

232
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:06,999
until my children
were born.

233
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,790
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

234
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,165
They did for me.

235
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:18,623
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

236
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,750
and I will.

237
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,623
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

238
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,958
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

239
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:32,582
The war against my sister
has already begun.

240
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,957
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

241
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,790
and join you in fighting

242
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,291
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

243
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,707
You don't believe him.

244
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,623
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

245
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:49,415
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

246
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,623
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

247
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,749
You were the first to bring
Dothraki to Westeros?

248
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,123
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

249
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,206
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

250
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,290
He was named
King in the North.

251
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,665
Not because
of his birthright.

252
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,040
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

253
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,081
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

254
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,791
because they
believe in him.

255
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,165
All those things
you don't believe in,

256
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,707
he faced those things.

257
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,915
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

258
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,498
He risked his life
for his people.

259
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,290
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

260
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,041
He gave his own...

261
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,957
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

262
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,040
we will die.

263
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,707
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

264
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,040
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

265
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,206
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

266
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:45,832
help her to defeat
my sister,

267
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,999
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,749
There's no time for that.

269
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,665
There's no time
for any of this!

270
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,165
While we stand here,
debating...

271
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,123
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

272
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,957
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

273
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,708
And why would I do that?

274
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,707
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

275
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,915
but I don't know you.

276
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,749
As far as I can tell,

277
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,040
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

278
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,374
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

279
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,165
The lords of the North

280
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,999
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

281
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,041
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

282
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,750
That's fair.

283
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:30,123
It's also fair
to point out

284
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:34,248
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

285
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:37,999
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

286
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,916
you are in
open rebellion.

287
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,206
Your Grace, please
dismiss your guests.

288
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,291
I have grave news.

289
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,707
You must forgive
my manners.

290
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,081
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

291
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:03,833
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

292
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,624
Am I your prisoner?

293
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,916
Not yet.

294
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,040
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

295
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,498
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

296
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,999
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,331
the rest,
sunk or captured.

298
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,915
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

299
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,498
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

300
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,207
All of them?

301
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,331
- Pull!
- Heave!

302
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:58,708
Pull!

303
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,416
Your sister's dead?

304
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,957
Euron has her.

305
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,332
You saw him take her?

306
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,999
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,499
I tried.

308
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,875
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

309
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:32,248
Come, men!

310
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:33,583
Sails up!

311
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,207
Murderer!

312
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,081
Whores!

313
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,416
Traitor!

314
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,541
This is the life.

315
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,416
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

316
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,331
I have to be honest,

317
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:17,291
this is making me hard.

318
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,999
Did you see
Little Theon's face

319
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,373
right before
he jumped overboard?

320
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:26,915
"Oh, no!"

321
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,374
What a twat.

322
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:59,082
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Murderers!

323
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,707
My queen, please
accept this gift

324
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:39,541
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

325
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:48,707
I give you what no
other man could give...

326
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,832
justice.

327
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,499
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

328
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:08,040
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

329
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,707
and a true friend
to the crown.

330
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,915
You deserve more
than a true friend.

331
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,415
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

332
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,082
There's only
one reward I want.

333
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:24,082
You shall have
what your heart desires...

334
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:27,666
when the war is won.

335
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,498
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

336
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,665
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

337
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,707
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

338
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,000
shall defend our country.

339
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:54,248
There's nothing quite
like it, is there?

340
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:55,999
The love of the people.

341
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,123
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

342
00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:01,457
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

343
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,206
And if you turn on us,

344
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,415
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

345
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,915
Or yours.

346
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,040
They just like
severed heads, really.

347
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,290
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

348
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,874
I would love to hear it.

349
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,915
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

350
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,623
Advice?

351
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:24,290
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

352
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,957
A finger in the bum?

353
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,249
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

354
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:50,040
I want you to know
I understand.

355
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,623
Even though we're
enemies, you and I,

356
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,291
I understand the fury
that drives you.

357
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:55,790
I was there that day

358
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,583
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

359
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,457
If I close my eyes,

360
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,457
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

361
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,665
The sound of your scream.

362
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,165
I never heard
a sound like that.

363
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,124
I thought,
"That's true love."

364
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,999
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

365
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,373
No one moved like him.

366
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:19,498
No one had such skill
with a spear.

367
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:22,582
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

368
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,040
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

369
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,999
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

370
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,040
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

371
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,874
Now he's buried
somewhere.

372
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,623
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

373
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:38,541
That must be
difficult for you.

374
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,498
When my daughter
was taken from me,

375
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:47,623
my only daughter...

376
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:50,415
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

377
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,665
unless you've
lost a child.

378
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,331
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

379
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:58,040
to give her
to the wet nurse.

380
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,540
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

381
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,790
I never got
to have a mother,

382
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,206
but Myrcella did.

383
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:08,874
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

384
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,916
Why did you do that?

385
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:18,875
Doesn't matter now.

386
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,206
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

387
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:32,832
Those brown eyes.

388
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,541
Those lips.

389
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,206
Perfect Dornish beauty.

390
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,081
I imagine
she's your favorite.

391
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:43,248
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

392
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,416
but still,
we're only human.

393
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,499
We love whom we love.

394
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,373
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

395
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:56,749
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

396
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,583
It must be frustrating.

397
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,749
We all make our choices.

398
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,165
You chose to murder
my daughter.

399
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,415
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

400
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,624
Do you feel powerful now?

401
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,582
I don't sleep very well.

402
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,957
Not at all, really.

403
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,874
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

404
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,248
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

405
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:30,124
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

406
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:33,290
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

407
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,457
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

408
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:40,165
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

409
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,124
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

410
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:45,958
She's so beautiful.

411
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,874
The thought
of this lovely face

412
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,290
cracking open
like a duck egg,

413
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,041
no, it's just not right.

414
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:01,624
Mama.

415
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,331
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

416
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:17,415
Clever enough to learn what poison
you used to murder Myrcella.

417
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:19,081
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

418
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:21,166
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

419
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:26,999
How long does
the poison take?

420
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,665
Difficult to say...
hours, days.

421
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,540
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

422
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:35,041
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

423
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,290
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

424
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,415
and you will be here
watching when she does.

425
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,207
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

426
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:55,040
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

427
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:58,749
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

428
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,040
To watch that
beautiful face collapse...

429
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,166
...to bone and dust.

430
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,499
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

431
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,206
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

432
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,624
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

433
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:48,875
No.

434
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,124
Don't.

435
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,999
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

436
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,666
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

437
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,331
Forgive me, Your Grace.

438
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:59,665
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

439
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,665
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

440
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,000
At once, Your Grace.

441
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,248
No, thank you.

442
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:18,957
My condolences,
Your Grace,

443
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,915
on the death of your son.

444
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,623
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

445
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:26,373
The Iron Bank didn't send you
here to offer condolences.

446
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:29,874
Condolences
and congratulations.

447
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,832
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

448
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,832
that's quite
an accomplishment.

449
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,623
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

450
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:40,206
freeing the crown
from elements

451
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,707
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

452
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,874
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

453
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:50,081
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

454
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,457
to restore order
and rational leadership.

455
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,206
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

456
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,790
Your father never
minced words either.

457
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,623
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

458
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:04,498
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

459
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:07,415
We both know how
expensive war can be.

460
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,623
And we both know
gold wins wars.

461
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:11,081
Your vaults are empty.

462
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,582
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

463
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:16,915
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

464
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:20,498
You are surrounded on all sides
by rivals for the throne.

465
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:22,457
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

466
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,165
We don't make bets.

467
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,749
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

468
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,707
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

469
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:34,457
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

470
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,457
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

471
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,498
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

472
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,957
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

473
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,457
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

474
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,665
For now.

475
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,415
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

476
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:53,749
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

477
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,790
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

478
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,165
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

479
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,081
You want to
invest in her?

480
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:07,457
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

481
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,707
How are your profits

482
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,248
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

483
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,415
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

484
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,290
From what I gather,
she considers herself

485
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,623
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

486
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,540
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

487
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,540
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

488
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,707
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

489
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:35,124
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

490
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,707
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

491
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,040
Give me a fortnight.

492
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,248
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

493
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,665
And when you
return to Braavos,

494
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:50,124
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

495
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,583
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

496
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,665
You're making it
difficult.

497
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:25,332
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

498
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,582
You make me feel like I'm failing
at brooding over failing.

499
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,290
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

500
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:35,248
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

501
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:36,749
You're free
to walk the castle,

502
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,665
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

503
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,832
Except to my ship.

504
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,248
You took my ship.

505
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,206
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

506
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,707
I'm not playing
word games with you.

507
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,582
The dead are coming
for us all.

508
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,248
Why don't you
figure out what to do

509
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,331
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

510
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:55,206
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

511
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,415
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

512
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:00,541
If someone told me about the white
walkers and the Night King...

513
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,207
You probably
don't believe me.

514
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,832
I do, actually.

515
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,374
You didn't before.

516
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,290
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

517
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,373
Do you remember?

518
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:23,457
You said
it was all nonsense.

519
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,582
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

520
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,707
But then Mormont saw them

521
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,123
and you saw them.

522
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:32,790
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

523
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,791
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

524
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,373
How do I convince people
who don't know me

525
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:41,123
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

526
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:44,457
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

527
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,623
I'm looking
for an answer.

528
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:50,915
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

529
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,373
White walkers,
the Night King,

530
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,457
Army of the Dead...

531
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,081
it's almost a relief
to confront

532
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,958
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

533
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:05,249
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

534
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,291
I can't help them
from here.

535
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,041
I'd like to leave.

536
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,999
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

537
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,666
by giving up that easily.

538
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,957
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

539
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,749
Don't go south.

540
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,415
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

541
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,833
a foreign invader.

542
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:33,915
And here I am,

543
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,457
a Northern fool.

544
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,915
Children are not
their fathers,

545
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,624
luckily for all of us.

546
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,331
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

547
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:45,540
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

548
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:49,749
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

549
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,582
Instead, she stayed
where she was

550
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,248
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

551
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,582
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

552
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,165
While you're
our guest here,

553
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,707
you might consider
asking them

554
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,457
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

555
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:05,540
She protects people
from monsters,

556
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,081
just as you do.

557
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,540
It's why she came here.

558
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,081
And she's not about
to head north

559
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:12,540
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

560
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,040
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

561
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,457
After a single meeting,

562
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,249
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

563
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,875
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

564
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,874
What do you mean?

565
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,123
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

566
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:40,791
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

567
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,290
- Dragonglass?
- Yes.

568
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:47,749
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

569
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,749
He says you have a tremendous
amount of it here.

570
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,540
Why are we talking
about glass?

571
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,415
We just lost
two of our allies.

572
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:56,791
Which is why I was speaking to
Jon Snow, a potential ally.

573
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,915
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

574
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:05,248
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

575
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,373
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

576
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,540
Or stop them.

577
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,832
Destroy them.

578
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,458
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

579
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:18,373
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

580
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:21,248
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

581
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:23,874
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

582
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:27,123
But a wise man once said that you
should never believe a thing

583
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,666
simply because
you want to believe it.

584
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:35,540
Which wise man said this?

585
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,415
I don't remember.

586
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,833
Are you trying to present your own
statements as ancient wisdom?

587
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,248
I would never do that.

588
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,291
To you.

589
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,790
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

590
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,206
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

591
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,290
I would have told him
not to come.

592
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,623
And he's here anyway.

593
00:38:57,624 --> 00:39:00,040
You don't
have to believe him.

594
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,081
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

595
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:03,707
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

596
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,790
You didn't even know
it was here.

597
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,331
It's nothing to you.

598
00:39:08,332 --> 00:39:11,623
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

599
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:14,331
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

600
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,915
with a possible ally.

601
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,290
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand...

602
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,666
Casterly Rock.

603
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,707
What was that
Ser Davos said

604
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,749
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

605
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,540
Did you notice that?

606
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,999
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

607
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,166
It's dreary in the North.

608
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,541
Amazing thing to see.

609
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,082
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

610
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,708
They're both gone now.

611
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,374
You lost
two brothers as well.

612
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:09,416
People thought dragons were gone
forever, but here they are.

613
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:14,000
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

614
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,248
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

615
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:24,999
He is my Hand.

616
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,624
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

617
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:30,583
I don't.

618
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,582
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

619
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:39,749
I never expected
that you would.

620
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,999
And I haven't
changed my mind

621
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,081
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

622
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:44,916
I haven't either.

623
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,457
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

624
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,458
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

625
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:05,833
Thank you.

626
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:16,124
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

627
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,000
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

628
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,290
How much do we have?

629
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,373
4,000 bushels, my lady.

630
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,540
What does that mean?

631
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,623
For the current
occupants of the castle,

632
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:57,290
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

633
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:00,707
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

634
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,165
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

635
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,999
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

636
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,498
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

637
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:10,623
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

638
00:42:10,624 --> 00:42:13,833
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

639
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:17,331
No, my lady,
most likely not.

640
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:19,457
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

641
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,540
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

642
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,832
this is
the best place to be.

643
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,790
We need to start
building up our grain stores

644
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,373
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

645
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:30,665
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

646
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,999
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

647
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,707
they won't have enough time to bring
wagonloads of grain with them.

648
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,123
Very wise, my lady.

649
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,916
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

650
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,206
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

651
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:47,582
No, my lady.

652
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,665
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

653
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,081
They should, indeed.

654
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:54,290
Pardon me, my lady.

655
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,875
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

656
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,666
Command suits you.

657
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,457
The Northerners
are all facing north,

658
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,540
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

659
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,081
So they should be.

660
00:43:08,082 --> 00:43:10,749
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

661
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,832
If you turn
your back on her...

662
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:16,749
- You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
- I only meant to say...

663
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,290
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

664
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,374
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

665
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,874
One of two things
will happen...

666
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:28,165
either the dead
will defeat the living,

667
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,123
in which case...

668
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:32,206
all our troubles
come to an end,

669
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,582
or life will win out.

670
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,582
And what then?

671
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:40,583
Don't fight in the
North or the South.

672
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:47,041
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

673
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,832
Everyone is your enemy,

674
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,749
everyone
is your friend...

675
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,874
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

676
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:01,457
Live that way and nothing
will surprise you.

677
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,040
Everything that happens
will be something

678
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,958
that you've seen before.

679
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:10,958
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

680
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:44,666
Hello, Sansa.

681
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,665
I wish Jon were here.

682
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,541
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

683
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,332
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

684
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,040
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

685
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:25,290
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

686
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,123
I can never be
lord of anything.

687
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,374
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

688
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,248
I don't know
what that means.

689
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:34,665
It's difficult
to explain.

690
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,875
Try.
Please, for me.

691
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,540
It means I can see
everything.

692
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,874
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

693
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,874
Everything that's
happening right now.

694
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:51,665
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

695
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,874
I need to learn
to see better.

696
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:57,290
When the Long Night
comes again,

697
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,916
I need to be ready.

698
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,373
How do you know all this?

699
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:05,915
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

700
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:07,832
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

701
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,583
I told you it's
difficult to explain.

702
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,248
Bran...

703
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:16,623
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

704
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:20,624
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

705
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,916
It was so beautiful
that night.

706
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:33,916
Snow falling,
just like now.

707
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,000
And you were
so beautiful...

708
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,750
in your white
wedding dress.

709
00:46:46,624 --> 00:46:48,499
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

710
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,583
I'll stay a bit longer.

711
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,833
Hmm.

712
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,166
Hmm.

713
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:24,498
Does it hurt?

714
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:27,207
A bit.
Less than before.

715
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,624
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

716
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,040
Unusual.

717
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,498
Unlikely.

718
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,498
One could almost
be forgiven

719
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:42,081
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

720
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:46,457
and the underlying region treated
with some sort of unguent.

721
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,749
Don't know
anything about that.

722
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,832
I just started
feeling better.

723
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:55,499
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

724
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,081
And the climate.

725
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:02,040
The climate.

726
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,832
You're free to go, ser.

727
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,874
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

728
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,582
which you are no longer.

729
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:11,082
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

730
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,332
How bad is it?

731
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,374
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

732
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:26,206
Where will you go?

733
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:29,916
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

734
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:34,206
I knew it would kill me

735
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:36,874
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

736
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,123
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

737
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:43,749
The only place for me
is back with her.

738
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,165
I owe her my life.

739
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:48,750
Her and you.

740
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,290
Your father saved me
more than once.

741
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,082
It's the least
I could do.

742
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:59,957
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

743
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,374
I hope they do.

744
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:31,957
- You treated him?
- Yes.

745
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,457
Who told you
to treat him?

746
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:35,790
No one.

747
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:39,081
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

748
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:41,790
I seem to remember you.

749
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:44,624
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

750
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:49,415
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

751
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:51,749
especially on
someone of that age.

752
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,957
You could have infected
yourself and others.

753
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,416
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

754
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,623
But you didn't.

755
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,248
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

756
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:07,665
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

757
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,123
have attempted it
and failed.

758
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:12,206
Yet you succeeded.

759
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,332
How?

760
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:18,624
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

761
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,207
That man is alive
because of you.

762
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:35,124
You should be proud.

763
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,707
Thank you, Archmaester.

764
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:41,624
Come here.

765
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:49,331
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

766
00:50:49,332 --> 00:50:52,000
I need you
to make copies of them.

767
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,374
You were expecting
a reward.

768
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:03,875
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

769
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,040
You'd better get started.

770
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,707
And careful
of the paper mites.

771
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,041
They like flesh as well.

772
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:20,665
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

773
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:24,165
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

774
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,707
To send our remaining
ships after him...

775
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,374
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

776
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:33,749
Would you have to go
yourself?

777
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,749
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

778
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,749
or in more than
one place.

779
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,165
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

780
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:41,206
for who knows how long.

781
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:42,832
I wouldn't be alone.

782
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,415
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

783
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,206
What can anyone
do to them?

784
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:49,206
They can still
do something to you.

785
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,999
It only takes one arrow.

786
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,541
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

787
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,999
What about Casterly Rock?

788
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,957
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

789
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,540
And what will they face?

790
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,957
A difficult situation.

791
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,081
They know we're coming.

792
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,415
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

793
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,040
is to destroy
House Lannister.

794
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,791
She will be ready.

795
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,415
No one has ever taken the Rock.
Archers!

796
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:22,790
The Lannister Army is still
the army my father built.

797
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,123
Come on! Well-trained
and well-provisioned.

798
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:26,915
10,000 men at least.

799
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:27,876
They will see us coming.

800
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:34,124
They will be ready.

801
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,458
- Draw! Loose!
- Loose!

802
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:44,791
The gates of Casterly Rock
are impregnable.

803
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:54,749
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

804
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,291
We will be
at a disadvantage.

805
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,332
Many men will die.

806
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:03,541
Just as my father
said they would.

807
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,331
Interesting thing
about my father...

808
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,248
he built our house up
from near ruin.

809
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:14,415
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

810
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:16,498
but he didn't
build the sewers.

811
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:18,582
That was beneath him,

812
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:21,457
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find...

813
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,999
me.

814
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,832
He was right, I was low.

815
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,957
The company I kept, low.

816
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,498
Women, mostly.

817
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:30,165
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

818
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:32,457
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

819
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:34,081
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

820
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,540
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

821
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,790
so in the process
of building the sewers,

822
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:40,541
I threw in something
for myself.

823
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,582
It was a passage
that began

824
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,290
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

825
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:49,707
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

826
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,916
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

827
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:58,291
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

828
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:04,206
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

829
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,166
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

830
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,916
And so it begins.

831
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:24,540
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

832
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,415
They will be outnumbered.

833
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:28,750
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

834
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:37,498
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

835
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:40,457
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

836
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,457
They will be fighting
for freedom

837
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,248
and the person
who gave it to them.

838
00:54:44,249 --> 00:54:46,749
They will be fighting
for you.

839
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,207
And that is why
they will triumph.

840
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,165
Where are they?!

841
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,791
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

842
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,916
- It's done.
- It is.

843
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,916
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

844
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:20,707
Did we fight well?

845
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:23,749
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

846
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,874
It was never our forte.

847
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,958
Golden roses, indeed.

848
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,915
Your brother
and his new queen

849
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,832
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

850
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,123
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

851
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:39,707
Well, it is to me,

852
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,040
but my fond
childhood memories

853
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,582
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

854
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,707
So you just
let them take it?

855
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,749
For now. They won't
be able to hold it.

856
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,290
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

857
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,290
we emptied the larders
before we left.

858
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,540
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

859
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,957
and march all the way
across Westeros.

860
00:57:57,958 --> 00:58:01,123
And you took your army,
your real army,

861
00:58:01,124 --> 00:58:02,999
and went
where they weren't.

862
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,331
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

863
00:58:06,332 --> 00:58:08,373
There are always
lessons in failures.

864
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:11,958
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

865
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:16,123
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

866
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:17,874
If he was so clever,

867
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,623
why didn't he take
Highgarden

868
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:23,332
the moment your
gold mines ran dry?

869
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:28,790
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

870
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:31,875
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

871
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,832
How will you do it?

872
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,290
With that sword?

873
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,665
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

874
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,999
Not that he ever used it.

875
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,666
What did he call it?

876
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,623
Widow's Wail.

877
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:51,833
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

878
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:58,832
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

879
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:02,874
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

880
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:06,040
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

881
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,081
They were necessary.

882
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:10,123
And whatever
I imagined necessary

883
00:59:10,124 --> 00:59:14,040
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

884
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:18,666
But your sister
has done things...

885
00:59:20,332 --> 00:59:22,665
I was incapable
of imagining.

886
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:25,498
That was
my prize mistake...

887
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:28,041
a failure of imagination.

888
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:31,832
She's a monster,
you do know that?

889
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,999
To you, I'm sure.

890
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,874
To others as well.

891
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:39,373
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

892
00:59:39,374 --> 00:59:43,707
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

893
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:47,416
do you really think they'll wring their
hands over the way she built it?

894
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,040
You love her.

895
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:53,832
You really do love her.

896
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,290
You poor fool.

897
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,040
She'll be the end of you.

898
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,582
Possibly.

899
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,373
Not much to be gained

900
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:04,415
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

901
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:07,123
What better person
to discuss it with?

902
01:00:07,124 --> 01:00:09,040
What better guarantee
could you have

903
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:13,081
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

904
01:00:13,082 --> 01:00:16,123
But perhaps you're right.

905
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:17,707
If she's driven you
this far,

906
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,124
it's gone beyond
your control.

907
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,415
Yes.

908
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,875
It has.

909
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,999
She's a disease.

910
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,957
I regret my role
in spreading it.

911
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,540
You will, too.

912
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,291
I think we're done here.

913
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,750
How will it happen?

914
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,206
Cersei had several ideas.

915
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:43,623
Whipping you
through the streets

916
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:46,290
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

917
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:50,124
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

918
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:55,082
I talked her
out of those.

919
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:13,749
Will there be pain?

920
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,331
No. I made sure
of that.

921
01:01:16,332 --> 01:01:17,666
That's good.

922
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,458
I'd hate to die
like your son.

923
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,123
Clawing at my neck,

924
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,999
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

925
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,832
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

926
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,206
Must have been
horrible for you,

927
01:01:44,207 --> 01:01:47,665
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

928
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,248
It was horrible
enough for me.

929
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,915
A shocking scene.

930
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:55,708
Not at all
what I intended.

931
01:01:57,666 --> 01:02:02,249
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

932
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:09,373
Tell Cersei.

933
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:11,833
I want her to know
it was me.

934
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,665
My only venture at this moment

935
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,290
is reestablishing control
over this continent

936
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:01,833
and every person on it.

937
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,498
All my allies are gone.

938
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:06,332
I'm losing.

939
01:04:07,082 --> 01:04:10,207
You can count on the Iron Bank.
As soon as the gold arrives.

940
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:12,791
Enough with the clever plans.
