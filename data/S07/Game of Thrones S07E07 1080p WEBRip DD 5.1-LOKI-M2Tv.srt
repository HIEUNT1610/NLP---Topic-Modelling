00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,500
#<font color="#20e020">HI removed, cleaned
#and corrected by Tronar</font>

2
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:11,004
Little Theon! Come and get her.

3
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:22,628
It's an invitation...
to King's Landing.

4
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,128
You will represent my interests

5
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,753
at this gathering
as you see them.

6
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,213
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,921
She's your sister.

8
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,712
Arya would never betray
her family.

9
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,338
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

10
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,629
With the faces,
I can become someone else.

11
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:44,213
I wonder what it would feel like
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,088
All I'd need to find out...
is your face.

13
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:55,045
Daenerys will win this war.

14
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:56,503
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

15
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,503
you can ask her yourself.

16
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:59,545
She has
a more important request.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,087
Cersei thinks the army
of the dead is nothing

18
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:04,379
but a story.
What if we prove her wrong?

19
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,545
Bring the dead to her.

20
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:13,796
Go!

21
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,420
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

22
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,754
Thank you, my queen.

23
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,961
- Oil?
- Pitch, my lord.

24
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:28,504
- How many barrels?
- 500, my lord.

25
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,586
Get 500 more.

26
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:33,587
Yes, my lord.

27
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:49,003
I still enjoy it
when they call me "my lord."

28
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:51,461
The thrill will fade.

29
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:52,962
If we live that long.

30
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,170
Men without cocks.

31
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,878
You wouldn't find me
fighting in an army

32
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,836
if I had no cock.

33
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:02,295
What's left to fight for?

34
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,170
Gold?

35
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,003
I spent my life
around soldiers.

36
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,129
What do you think
they spend that gold on?

37
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,337
Family.

38
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:13,004
Not without a cock,
you don't.

39
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,171
Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

40
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:22,544
Yet, your brother has chosen
to side with the cockless.

41
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:27,420
Yes, he's always been
a champion of the downtrodden.

42
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,379
I think we're about to be
the downtrodden.

43
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,795
Archers, stand tall!

44
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:15,754
Cover that wall!

45
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:46,795
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

46
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:50,920
That's more people than the
entire North crammed into that.

47
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,087
Why would anyone
want to live that way?

48
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,544
There's more work
in the city.

49
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,754
And the brothels
are far superior.

50
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,128
Why isn't she with them?

51
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,295
I'm afraid I don't know,
Your Grace.

52
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:42,461
No one has seen her.

53
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,128
And the rest of them?

54
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,378
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

55
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,670
Including our brother?

56
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,462
Yes, Your Grace.

57
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,295
If anything goes wrong,

58
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,337
kill the silver-haired
bitch first,

59
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,628
then our brother, then the
bastard who calls himself king.

60
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,670
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

61
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,461
Come, Ser Gregor.

62
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,629
It's time for us
to meet our guests.

63
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,544
Why did they build it?

64
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,170
Dragons don't understand
the difference

65
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:24,378
between what is theirs
and what isn't.

66
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,045
Land, livestock,
children...

67
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,586
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

68
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:34,378
I imagine it was
a sad joke at the end.

69
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,836
An entire arena for a few sickly
creatures smaller than dogs.

70
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:41,337
But in the beginning, when it
was home to Balerion the Dread,

71
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,712
it must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.

72
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,046
Maybe it still is.

73
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,046
Welcome, my lords.

74
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,087
Your friends arrived
before you did.

75
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,962
I've been sent to escort
you all to the meeting.

76
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,419
A pleasant surprise
in an unpleasant situation.

77
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,087
I never thought I'd see
you again, my lord.

78
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,628
Supporting the enemy,
no less.

79
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,379
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

80
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,087
I'm glad you're alive.

81
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,337
Come on!

82
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,796
You can suck
his magic cock later.

83
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,837
What's in there?

84
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,629
Fuck off.

85
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,961
I thought you were dead.

86
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:16,128
Not yet.

87
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:18,462
You came pretty close.

88
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:22,420
I was only trying
to protect her.

89
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,711
You and me both.

90
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,628
She's alive.

91
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,796
Arya.

92
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,670
- Where?
- Winterfell.

93
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,669
Who's protecting her
if you're here?

94
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,170
The only one
that needs protecting

95
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,504
is the one that gets
in her way.

96
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,046
It won't be me.

97
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,253
Here we are...

98
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,795
the heroes
of Blackwater Bay.

99
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,378
Strange place
for a reunion.

100
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,253
It is, my lord.

101
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:01,337
I don't think I'm anyone's
lord anymore, Podrick.

102
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,920
Save the titles for
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

103
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,836
I'm sure your new queen will
be happy to restore yours

104
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,295
if she ends up
on the throne.

105
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,419
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

106
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,753
Perhaps you've been
reconsidering your allegiances.

107
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,795
Remember my offer...

108
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:20,212
whatever they're paying
you, I'll pay double.

109
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,753
And that would be
double what now, exactly?

110
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:25,295
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

111
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:27,628
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

112
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,087
Helping me to arrange
this meeting

113
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,544
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

114
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:33,337
You put yourself at risk.

115
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,212
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

116
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:39,711
It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

117
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:41,503
Now, thanks to me,

118
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:44,711
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

119
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,170
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

120
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:50,045
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

121
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:53,253
All thanks to Ser Bronn
of the fucking Blackwater.

122
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,545
If that's not looking after
myself, I don't know what is.

123
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,587
It's good
to see you again.

124
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,046
Yeah, you, too.

125
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:16,754
Anyone touches it,
I'll kill you first.

126
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,419
Come on, Pod.

127
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,920
Let's you and me
go have a drink

128
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,462
while the fancy folks
talk, eh?

129
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,503
I left this shit city

130
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:53,337
because I didn't
want to die in it.

131
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,629
Am I going to die
in this shit city?

132
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,795
You might.

133
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,212
And this is all
your idea.

134
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:04,544
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.

135
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,712
And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

136
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,419
Remember me?

137
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,337
Yeah, you do.

138
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:15,419
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

139
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,921
What did they do to you?

140
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,253
Doesn't matter.

141
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,461
That's not how it ends
for you, brother.

142
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:26,711
You know who's
coming for you.

143
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,796
You've always known.

144
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,338
Where is she?

145
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:46,878
She'll be here soon.

146
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,129
Didn't travel with you?

147
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:50,921
No.

148
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,920
We've been here
for some time.

149
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,213
My apologies.

150
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,170
We are all
facing a unique...

151
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,212
Theon!

152
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,128
I have your sister.

153
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:07,545
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

154
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,338
I'll kill her.

155
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,544
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

156
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,753
Then why are you talking?

157
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,962
You're the smallest
concern here.

158
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,212
Do you remember when we
discussed dwarf jokes?

159
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,961
His wasn't even good.

160
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,295
He explained it
at the end.

161
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,836
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

162
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,337
We don't even
let your kind live

163
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:36,544
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

164
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,753
We kill you at birth.

165
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,795
An act of mercy
for the parents.

166
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,461
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

167
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:44,920
Why?

168
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:47,129
Sit down or leave.

169
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:11,337
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

170
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:13,879
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

171
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,669
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

172
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,045
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

173
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:23,337
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

174
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,586
there would be no need
for this gathering.

175
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,628
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

176
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,337
without meeting
face-to-face.

177
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,212
So instead, we should
settle our differences

178
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,878
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

179
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,295
We all know
that will never happen.

180
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,670
Then why are we here?

181
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,046
This isn't about
living in harmony.

182
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:46,337
It's just about living.

183
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,920
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

184
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,961
A general you can't
negotiate with.

185
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:54,711
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

186
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:58,295
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

187
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,711
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

188
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,420
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

189
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,004
This is serious.

190
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,170
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

191
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,003
I don't think
it's serious at all.

192
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,461
I think it's
another bad joke.

193
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,212
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

194
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:20,836
you're asking me
for a truce.

195
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,379
Yes.
That's all.

196
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,462
That's all?

197
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:29,419
Pull back my armies
and stand down

198
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,128
while you go
on your monster hunt.

199
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,711
Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

200
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:38,087
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

201
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:41,753
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

202
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:46,088
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

203
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:48,795
You have my word.

204
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:50,920
The word of
a would-be usurper.

205
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,920
There is no conversation

206
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:56,961
that will erase
the last 50 years.

207
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:59,171
We have something
to show you.

208
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,254
We can destroy them
by burning them.

209
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:30,254
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

210
00:23:32,296 --> 00:23:34,087
If we don't win
this fight,

211
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:38,088
then that is the fate
of every person in the world.

212
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:57,961
There is only one war
that matters...

213
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:00,296
the Great War.

214
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,796
And it is here.

215
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:09,129
I didn't believe it
until I saw them.

216
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,796
I saw them all.

217
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:16,711
How many?

218
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:18,129
A hundred thousand,
at least.

219
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,338
Can they swim?

220
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:38,628
No.

221
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,004
Good.

222
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:44,503
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

223
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,586
What are you
talking about?

224
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,503
I've been
around the world.

225
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,878
I've seen everything,
things you couldn't imagine,

226
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,338
and this...

227
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:58,129
this is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

228
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,378
I'm going back
to my island.

229
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:10,045
You should go
back to yours.

230
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:12,003
When winter's over,

231
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:14,670
we'll be the only ones
left alive.

232
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,171
He's right to be afraid.

233
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,128
And a coward to run.

234
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,378
If those things
come for us,

235
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:33,295
there will be
no kingdoms to rule.

236
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,711
Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

237
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:38,504
Everything we lost
will have been for nothing.

238
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:42,046
The crown accepts
your truce.

239
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:48,420
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

240
00:25:57,254 --> 00:26:00,254
In return, the King in the
North will extend this truce.

241
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:04,461
He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

242
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,378
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

243
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,795
He will not choose sides.

244
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:11,087
Just the King
in the North?

245
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:13,544
Not me?

246
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:16,170
I would never
ask it of you.

247
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:17,753
You would never
agree to it.

248
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,254
And if you did, I would trust
you even less than I do now.

249
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:24,503
I ask it only
of Ned Stark's son.

250
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:28,046
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

251
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:45,003
I am true to my word.

252
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,754
Or I try to be.

253
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:52,462
That is why I cannot
give you what you ask.

254
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:56,462
I cannot serve
two queens.

255
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:00,253
And I have already
pledged myself

256
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:04,004
to Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

257
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:17,711
Then there is
nothing left to discuss.

258
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:20,711
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

259
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:22,712
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

260
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,836
Ser Jaime.

261
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,295
It's been good
to see you.

262
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:36,295
I imagine the next time
will be across a battlefield.

263
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,878
We both saw
what just happened.

264
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,628
We both saw
that... thing.

265
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:42,419
Yes, and I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

266
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,087
But I'm loyal
to the queen,

267
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:46,003
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

268
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,128
Oh, fuck loyalty!

269
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:49,669
Fuck loyalty?

270
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,212
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

271
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,712
Talk to the queen.

272
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:01,712
And tell her what?

273
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,213
I wish you hadn't
done that.

274
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:21,378
I'm grateful
for your loyalty,

275
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:25,461
but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

276
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:27,878
If it's all for nothing,

277
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,045
then he died for nothing.

278
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,544
I know!

279
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:34,212
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

280
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,920
I would have advised
it, had you asked.

281
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:38,878
But have you
ever considered

282
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,087
learning how to lie
every now and then?

283
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,088
Just a bit?

284
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:46,462
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

285
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:49,419
Talk about my father
if you want,

286
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,503
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

287
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:55,586
But when enough people
make false promises,

288
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,753
words stop meaning
anything.

289
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:01,920
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

290
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,669
And lies won't help us
in this fight.

291
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,753
That is indeed a problem.

292
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:10,296
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

293
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,920
Any ideas
as to how we might

294
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,921
change that state
of affairs?

295
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,753
Only one.

296
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:20,170
Everyone stays here,

297
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:22,961
and I go and talk
to my sister.

298
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:27,378
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

299
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:29,170
I don't want Cersei
to murder me either.

300
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:32,170
I could have stayed in my cell and
saved a great deal of trouble.

301
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,212
I did this.

302
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:36,711
- I should go.
- She'll definitely murder you.

303
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:40,088
I go see my sister alone.

304
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:43,087
Or we all go home

305
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:44,837
and we're right back
where we started.

306
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:51,045
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

307
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:54,128
She thinks I was an
idiot to trust you.

308
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,253
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

309
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,878
I'm about to step
into a room

310
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,669
with the most murderous
woman in the world

311
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,586
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

312
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:05,213
Who's an idiot?

313
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,087
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

314
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,670
one idiot to another.

315
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,503
I shouldn't be
surprised, I suppose.

316
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,295
She's your kind
of woman...

317
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:17,836
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

318
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:21,628
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

319
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,337
That must be
difficult for you.

320
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:25,795
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

321
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:27,711
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

322
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,795
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

323
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:31,920
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

324
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,003
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction of this family.

325
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:38,337
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

326
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,878
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

327
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,337
She didn't want
to bring you words.

328
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:44,295
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

329
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,419
until I advised her
otherwise.

330
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,212
I don't want
to destroy our family.

331
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,170
I never have.

332
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,628
You killed our father.

333
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:53,253
After he sentenced me
to death

334
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,836
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

335
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:57,503
Hate me for it
if you want.

336
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:59,836
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

337
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:02,295
in spite of
what he did to me.

338
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,045
Oh, poor little man.

339
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:05,753
Your papa
was mean to you.

340
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:09,795
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

341
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,628
You left us open.

342
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,212
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

343
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:16,753
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

344
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:18,419
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

345
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,337
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

346
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:22,378
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

347
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,961
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

348
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,669
I will not hear it,
not from you.

349
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,420
I will not hear it!

350
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,711
All right.

351
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,170
You love your family,

352
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:38,253
and I have destroyed it.

353
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:41,003
I will always
be a threat.

354
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,338
So put an end to me.

355
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,378
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

356
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:56,128
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

357
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,461
If it weren't for me,

358
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,544
you'd have
two beautiful children.

359
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,711
I've thought
about killing you

360
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,379
more times
than I can count.

361
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,379
Do it!
Say the word.

362
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:19,295
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

363
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:22,461
- I will not...
- I don't care. I loved them.

364
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,337
You know I did.

365
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,837
You know it in your heart if
there's anything left of it.

366
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,670
It doesn't matter.

367
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:37,253
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

368
00:35:37,254 --> 00:35:39,419
I don't care
why you did what you did.

369
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,295
I only care
what it cost us.

370
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:43,670
It cost us our future.

371
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,461
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

372
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:49,461
Why did you
allow me to come?

373
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:52,503
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

374
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,253
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

375
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,796
but you must have
hoped for something.

376
00:35:57,837 --> 00:36:00,378
What did you hope for?

377
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:04,045
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

378
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:06,419
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

379
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,170
- Yes.
- Why?

380
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,753
Because I think

381
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:11,586
she will make the world
a better place.

382
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,504
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

383
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:17,628
She knows herself.

384
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,170
She chose an advisor

385
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:22,503
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

386
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:24,503
That's the difference
between you.

387
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:26,711
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

388
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:29,337
I don't care about making
the world a better place.

389
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,128
Hang the world.

390
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,586
That thing
you dragged here,

391
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:37,045
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

392
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,253
And when it came at me, I
didn't think about the world.

393
00:36:39,254 --> 00:36:41,337
Not at all.

394
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,920
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

395
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:44,295
the world
disappeared for me,

396
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,419
right down
its black throat.

397
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,795
All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

398
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:50,337
away from the ones
who matter most,

399
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,128
away from my family.

400
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,753
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

401
00:36:55,754 --> 00:36:58,544
Get on a boat,
take those who matter...

402
00:36:58,545 --> 00:36:59,712
You're pregnant.

403
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,878
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

404
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,296
I know.

405
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,461
I respect what you did.

406
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:43,796
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

407
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:57,962
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

408
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:06,296
A dragon is not a slave.

409
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:11,586
They were terrifying.

410
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:13,296
Extraordinary.

411
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:17,753
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

412
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,004
and we locked them
in here.

413
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:22,837
They wasted away.

414
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:26,337
They grew small.

415
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,962
And we grew small
as well.

416
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:32,878
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

417
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,712
We were just like
everyone else.

418
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,670
You're not like
everyone else.

419
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:50,004
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

420
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:52,795
You're still here.

421
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:55,337
I can't have children.

422
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:56,920
Who told you that?

423
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:59,878
The witch who
murdered my husband.

424
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,087
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

425
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:03,879
a reliable source
of information?

426
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:11,836
You were right
from the beginning.

427
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:15,046
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

428
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:20,545
So, what now?

429
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,045
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

430
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:28,961
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

431
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:32,254
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

432
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:36,879
It appears Tyrion's
assessment was correct.

433
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,379
We're fucked.

434
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,629
My armies will not
stand down.

435
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,171
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

436
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:46,462
I will march them north to fight
alongside you in the Great War.

437
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,462
The darkness
is coming for us all.

438
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:55,212
We'll face it together.

439
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:58,003
And when
the Great War is over,

440
00:40:58,004 --> 00:41:01,337
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

441
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:04,796
with no promises or
assurances from any of you.

442
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,213
I expect not.

443
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,378
Call our banners.

444
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,879
All of them.

445
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:32,128
It's not easy for ravens
to fly in these storms.

446
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:34,128
Perhaps Jon tried
to send word earlier.

447
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:37,544
No, this is
the way he is,

448
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,920
the way he's always been.

449
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:42,544
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

450
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:46,295
I can't believe he'd surrender the
Northern crown without consulting you.

451
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,711
This is his writing,
his signature.

452
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:51,878
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

453
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,961
He's bent the knee.

454
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:56,544
I've heard gossip

455
00:41:56,545 --> 00:42:00,544
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

456
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:02,754
What does that have to do
with anything?

457
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:07,795
Jon is young
and unmarried.

458
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:10,003
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

459
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:12,961
You think he wants
to marry her?

460
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:16,212
An alliance makes sense.

461
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,420
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

462
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:23,046
He was named
King in the North.

463
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:26,879
He can be unnamed.

464
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,378
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

465
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,212
She always loved Jon far
more than she ever loved me,

466
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:39,419
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

467
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
You are family, too.

468
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,003
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

469
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,337
Do you know
what she is now?

470
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:51,711
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

471
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:53,920
Only by reputation.

472
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,087
They worship the God
of Death, I believe.

473
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,711
I never trust godly men.

474
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:01,212
They're killers.

475
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:03,088
And Arya was one of them.

476
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:09,544
What do you think
she's after?

477
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,128
She's your sister.

478
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:14,254
You know her far better
than I ever could.

479
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:22,544
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

480
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,462
I play a little game.

481
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:28,962
I assume the worst.

482
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:34,795
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

483
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:39,753
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

484
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:41,961
Then I ask myself,

485
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:45,128
"How well does
that reason explain

486
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:48,088
what they say
and what they do?"

487
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,461
So, tell me...

488
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,004
what's the worst thing
she could want?

489
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,836
She could want me dead

490
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:05,045
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

491
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:07,338
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

492
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:12,503
To kill me

493
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:16,337
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

494
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:19,338
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

495
00:44:22,046 --> 00:44:26,128
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

496
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:30,878
To provide justification
after she murders me.

497
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,544
And after
she murders you,

498
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:37,213
what does she become?

499
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,420
Lady of Winterfell.

500
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:02,378
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

501
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:05,045
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

502
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,544
And the Unsullied?

503
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,170
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

504
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,878
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

505
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:13,836
then ride together
to Winterfell.

506
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,087
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

507
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,586
You have many enemies
in the North.

508
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:21,836
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

509
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:25,544
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

510
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:27,753
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

511
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:30,795
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

512
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:33,420
The man who killed
the conqueror.

513
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:36,753
It's your decision,
Your Grace.

514
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:39,961
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

515
00:45:39,962 --> 00:45:44,045
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

516
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:47,212
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

517
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,462
I think it sends
a better message.

518
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,669
I've not come
to conquer the North.

519
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,004
I'm coming to save
the North.

520
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:07,962
We sail together.

521
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:24,129
Jon.

522
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,629
Can I speak with you?

523
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,088
All right.

524
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,544
What you did
in King's Landing,

525
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,670
what you said...

526
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:48,253
you could've
lied to Cersei

527
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:51,171
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

528
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,629
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

529
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:02,003
We went down there
to make peace.

530
00:47:02,004 --> 00:47:05,503
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

531
00:47:05,504 --> 00:47:06,879
if we're going
to fight together.

532
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,879
You've always known
what was right.

533
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:17,669
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

534
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,170
you always knew.

535
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,420
Every step you take...

536
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,753
it's always
the right step.

537
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:25,878
It's not.

538
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,128
It may seem that way
from the outside,

539
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:31,545
but I promise you,
it's not true.

540
00:47:33,962 --> 00:47:36,544
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

541
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:38,253
Not compared to me,
you haven't.

542
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:39,879
No.

543
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:43,504
Not compared to you.

544
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:57,379
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

545
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:02,128
Be the right
kind of person.

546
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,712
But I never knew
what that meant.

547
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:08,462
It always seemed
like there's...

548
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:14,962
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

549
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,213
Stark or Greyjoy.

550
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:27,087
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

551
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:29,920
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

552
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:31,795
Betrayed his memory.

553
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:32,754
I did.

554
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:39,545
But you never lost him.

555
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,504
He's a part of you.

556
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,795
Just like
he's a part of me.

557
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,962
But the things
I've done...

558
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,420
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

559
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:02,003
But what I can forgive,

560
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:03,420
I do.

561
00:49:09,796 --> 00:49:11,962
You don't need to choose.

562
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,254
You're a Greyjoy...

563
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:18,796
and you're a Stark.

564
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:35,419
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

565
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,461
Yara tried to save me.

566
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:43,003
She's the only one

567
00:49:43,004 --> 00:49:44,962
who tried to save me.

568
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:54,212
She needs me now.

569
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:57,004
So, why are you
still talking to me?

570
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:12,711
Load up.

571
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:14,337
Load up, lads.
Go on.

572
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:16,670
Tide's coming in.

573
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,379
All of us chose
to follow Yara.

574
00:50:37,837 --> 00:50:41,669
We left the Iron
Islands for Yara.

575
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,504
She would never
leave one of us behind.

576
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,087
We're not
leaving her behind.

577
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,544
Your sister's dead.

578
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:52,253
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

579
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:55,128
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

580
00:50:55,129 --> 00:51:00,253
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

581
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:01,754
I did.

582
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:07,003
I ran from my uncle.

583
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:08,419
I was a coward.

584
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,669
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

585
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,295
They say the dead
can't swim.

586
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:16,878
We're going to sail east,

587
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,253
find a nice,
quiet island,

588
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:22,253
kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

589
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:24,669
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

590
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,587
Yara did.
She made a pledge.

591
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,669
We're going to find her,

592
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,462
and we're going
to set her free.

593
00:51:43,921 --> 00:51:47,003
Run away, little Theon.

594
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,962
It's what you do best.

595
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:53,796
He needs to shut
his mouth.

596
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:03,504
Hey!

597
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:09,753
Oh, yes!

598
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:12,504
That's more like it.

599
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,338
Stay down...

600
00:52:31,629 --> 00:52:33,129
or I'll kill you!

601
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,171
I said stay down
or I'll kill you!

602
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:01,754
Not for me.

603
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:06,503
For Yara!

604
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:07,921
Yara!

605
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:55,962
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

606
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,213
Are you sure
you want to do this?

607
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:49,295
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

608
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:52,212
And what does
honor demand?

609
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:55,087
That I defend my family
from those who would harm us.

610
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:58,712
That I defend the North from
those who would betray us.

611
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:02,670
All right, then.

612
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:05,379
Get on with it.

613
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:10,378
You stand accused
of murder.

614
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:13,212
You stand accused
of treason.

615
00:56:13,213 --> 00:56:16,004
How do you answer
these charges...

616
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,254
Lord Baelish?

617
00:56:36,004 --> 00:56:37,545
My sister asked you
a question.

618
00:56:42,254 --> 00:56:43,754
Lady Sansa, forgive me...

619
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,212
I'm a bit confused.

620
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:49,503
Which charges
confuse you?

621
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,544
Let's start with
the simplest one...

622
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:54,128
you murdered our aunt,
Lysa Arryn.

623
00:56:54,129 --> 00:56:57,003
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

624
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,879
Do you deny it?

625
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,419
I did it to protect you.

626
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,461
You did it to take
power in the Vale.

627
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,753
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

628
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:10,253
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

629
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:11,296
Do you deny it?

630
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:16,795
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

631
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:19,129
she was a troubled woman.

632
00:57:20,462 --> 00:57:21,753
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

633
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:24,128
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

634
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,628
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

635
00:57:26,629 --> 00:57:28,128
when, really, it was you.

636
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:30,337
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

637
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:31,836
it was you
who started it.

638
00:57:31,837 --> 00:57:32,920
Do you deny it?

639
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,544
I know of no such letter.

640
00:57:34,545 --> 00:57:36,378
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

641
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:40,087
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

642
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:42,628
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

643
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:46,087
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

644
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,920
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

645
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:52,295
None of you were there
to see what happened.

646
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:54,253
None of you
knows the truth.

647
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:56,171
You held a knife
to his throat.

648
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:04,004
You said, "I did warn
you not the trust me."

649
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:12,004
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

650
00:58:13,338 --> 00:58:15,212
But that was another
one of your lies.

651
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:17,046
It was yours.

652
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:25,087
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

653
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,753
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

654
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,879
By selling me
to the Boltons?

655
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:33,544
If we could speak alone,

656
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:35,088
I can explain everything.

657
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:40,419
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

658
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,003
I play a little game.

659
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:44,670
I assume the worst.

660
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:47,961
What's the worst
reason you have

661
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,879
for turning me
against my sister?

662
00:58:51,712 --> 00:58:53,795
That's what you do,
isn't it?

663
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,628
That's what
you've always done...

664
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:57,461
turn family
against family,

665
00:58:57,462 --> 00:58:59,378
turn sister
against sister.

666
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,586
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

667
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:03,795
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

668
00:59:03,796 --> 00:59:05,128
Sansa, please.

669
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:08,961
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

670
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,419
But I learn.

671
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,669
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

672
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,962
I deserve that.

673
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:21,378
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

674
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:23,753
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

675
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:25,046
I think not.

676
00:59:28,338 --> 00:59:31,046
Sansa, I beg you!

677
00:59:32,545 --> 00:59:34,586
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

678
00:59:34,587 --> 00:59:36,379
And yet,
you betrayed her.

679
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,586
I loved you.

680
00:59:41,587 --> 00:59:43,213
More than anyone.

681
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:46,129
And yet, you betrayed me.

682
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:50,503
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

683
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,045
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

684
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:55,254
not unless we make it.

685
00:59:57,254 --> 01:00:01,669
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

686
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,962
I will never forget them.

687
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,587
Sansa!

688
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,796
I...

689
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:41,337
Our men in King's Landing

690
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,003
will march north
in three days' time.

691
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,378
It'll take us a fortnight

692
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,711
just to gather supplies
for the train.

693
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:47,253
We don't have
a fortnight.

694
01:00:47,254 --> 01:00:49,253
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

695
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:50,795
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

696
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:52,503
will take
the river road east.

697
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:54,045
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

698
01:00:54,046 --> 01:00:56,045
and march together
to Winterfell.

699
01:00:56,046 --> 01:00:57,213
Ser Jaime.

700
01:00:58,338 --> 01:00:59,711
Your Grace.

701
01:00:59,712 --> 01:01:02,171
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

702
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:05,629
Your Grace.

703
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:12,669
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

704
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,253
Expedition north?

705
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,544
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

706
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:21,212
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

707
01:01:21,213 --> 01:01:23,337
and you want to fight
alongside them?

708
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:25,295
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

709
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:27,253
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy...

710
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:28,711
I'll say whatever
I need to say

711
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:30,419
to ensure the survival
of our house.

712
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,170
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

713
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:36,753
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

714
01:01:36,754 --> 01:01:38,253
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

715
01:01:38,254 --> 01:01:40,170
You saw it
with your own eyes.

716
01:01:40,171 --> 01:01:42,544
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

717
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:44,378
I saw it burn.

718
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:46,212
If dragons
can't stop them,

719
01:01:46,213 --> 01:01:49,253
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

720
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:51,253
how will our armies
make a difference?

721
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:53,253
This isn't about
noble houses,

722
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:55,378
this is about
the living and the dead!

723
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,419
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

724
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,628
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

725
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,836
We stay here
where we've always been.

726
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:05,379
I made a promise.

727
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:10,961
Our child
will rule Westeros.

728
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:15,836
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

729
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:17,419
The monsters are real.

730
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,544
The white walkers,

731
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:21,795
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers...

732
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:25,795
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

733
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:27,503
So be it.

734
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:29,628
Let the monsters
kill each other.

735
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,878
And while they battle
in the North,

736
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:34,295
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

737
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,087
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

738
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:40,003
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

739
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:42,170
You understand that,
don't you?

740
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:45,669
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

741
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,753
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

742
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,711
they march south
and kill us all!

743
01:02:50,712 --> 01:02:53,711
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

744
01:02:53,712 --> 01:02:55,128
Most of them
will die in the North.

745
01:02:55,129 --> 01:02:56,711
I faced them
in the field.

746
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:59,253
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

747
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:00,795
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

748
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:02,795
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

749
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:05,295
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

750
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:08,628
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

751
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:11,419
She came here to show us
all her power.

752
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,461
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

753
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:17,003
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

754
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:18,836
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

755
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,504
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

756
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:27,461
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

757
01:03:27,462 --> 01:03:29,628
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

758
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:33,253
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

759
01:03:33,254 --> 01:03:35,836
But I listened,
I learned.

760
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:39,836
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

761
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:41,628
the Golden Company.

762
01:03:41,629 --> 01:03:45,337
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

763
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,003
The Golden Company
is not here.

764
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:48,378
They're in Essos.

765
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:52,337
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

766
01:03:52,338 --> 01:03:54,836
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

767
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:56,462
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

768
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,961
Do you think he abandoned

769
01:03:58,962 --> 01:04:02,212
the chance to marry
the queen?

770
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,545
No one walks away
from me.

771
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:08,045
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

772
01:04:08,046 --> 01:04:10,128
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

773
01:04:10,129 --> 01:04:11,670
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

774
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:17,378
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

775
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:19,212
the commander
of your armies?

776
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:21,836
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

777
01:04:21,837 --> 01:04:23,212
the man who murdered
our father,

778
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:24,544
without telling me,
your queen.

779
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:26,003
I didn't conspire
with him.

780
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:27,878
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

781
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:29,878
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

782
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:32,170
That is the definition
of conspiracy.

783
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:34,544
I pledged to ride north.

784
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:36,378
I intend to honor
that pledge.

785
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:38,586
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

786
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,836
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

787
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:42,171
What would you call it?

788
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,046
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

789
01:04:53,004 --> 01:04:55,754
I told you no one
walks away from me.

790
01:04:58,088 --> 01:05:00,629
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

791
01:05:02,754 --> 01:05:04,711
I'm the only one
you have left.

792
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:07,170
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

793
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,920
It's just me and you now.

794
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:10,921
There's one more
yet to come.

795
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:15,921
Give the order, then.

796
01:05:35,296 --> 01:05:37,004
I don't believe you.

797
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,420
Come in.

798
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,878
Samwell Tarly.

799
01:07:32,879 --> 01:07:35,087
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

800
01:07:35,088 --> 01:07:36,921
I remember everything.

801
01:07:45,088 --> 01:07:47,253
You helped us
get beyond the Wall.

802
01:07:47,254 --> 01:07:49,795
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

803
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:52,420
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

804
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:58,754
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

805
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:01,754
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

806
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,462
Oh!

807
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:10,128
I don't know
what that means.

808
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,878
I can see things
that happened in the past.

809
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:16,961
I can see things
happening now

810
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:18,462
all over the world.

811
01:08:19,879 --> 01:08:22,296
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

812
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:24,962
Um...

813
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,337
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

814
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,419
I know he is.

815
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,378
But he can't do it alone,

816
01:08:33,379 --> 01:08:36,253
so I've come here
to help him.

817
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:39,128
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

818
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:40,754
with Daenerys Targaryen.

819
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:44,961
You...
you saw this in...

820
01:08:44,962 --> 01:08:46,629
in a vision?

821
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:50,837
Oh.

822
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,837
He needs to know
the truth.

823
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,378
The truth about what?

824
01:08:58,379 --> 01:09:00,170
About himself.

825
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:03,711
No one knows.
No one but me.

826
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:06,669
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

827
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,836
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

828
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:14,669
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

829
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,128
His last name
isn't really Snow,

830
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:18,004
it's Sand.

831
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:21,379
It's not.

832
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:25,503
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

833
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:29,128
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

834
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:31,879
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

835
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,587
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

836
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:39,337
Are you certain?

837
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:42,045
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

838
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:43,879
I don't know
why he'd lie.

839
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:48,254
Is this something
you can see?

840
01:09:49,712 --> 01:09:53,544
Father, Smith, Warrior,

841
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:58,419
Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

842
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:02,212
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

843
01:10:02,213 --> 01:10:06,544
from this day
until the end of my days.

844
01:10:06,545 --> 01:10:09,670
Robert's Rebellion
was built on a lie.

845
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:14,921
Rhaegar didn't
kidnap my aunt or rape her.

846
01:10:24,504 --> 01:10:26,046
He loved her.

847
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,420
And she loved him.

848
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,796
And Jon...

849
01:11:06,837 --> 01:11:08,629
Jon's real name...

850
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:14,961
His name
is Aegon Targaryen.

851
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:17,171
You have to protect him.

852
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,587
Promise me, Ned.

853
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:45,670
He's never been a bastard.

854
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:52,296
He's the heir to
the Iron Throne.

855
01:12:07,129 --> 01:12:08,837
He needs to know.

856
01:12:12,046 --> 01:12:13,837
We need to tell him.

857
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:26,878
Are you all right?

858
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,795
It's just strange.

859
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:32,754
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

860
01:12:36,712 --> 01:12:38,253
You did the right thing.

861
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,795
You did it.

862
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:42,628
I'm just the executioner.

863
01:12:42,629 --> 01:12:44,379
You passed the sentence.

864
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,378
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

865
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:50,754
Does that bother you?

866
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:56,213
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

867
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,171
So I had to be
something else.

868
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:04,128
I never could have survived
what you survived.

869
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,461
You would have.

870
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,462
You're the strongest
person I know.

871
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:15,088
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

872
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:20,461
Well, don't get
used to it.

873
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,712
You're still very
strange and annoying.

874
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:31,213
"In winter, we must
protect ourselves.

875
01:13:32,754 --> 01:13:34,796
Look after
one another."

876
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:38,629
Father.

877
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:45,920
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

878
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,878
the lone wolf dies,

879
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:50,338
but the pack survives."

880
01:13:57,338 --> 01:13:58,629
I miss him.

881
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:03,462
Me, too.

882
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:27,212
It's a long way down.

883
01:15:27,213 --> 01:15:31,046
Yeah. The crows keep telling
me I'll get used to it.

884
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:42,836
I can see movement...

885
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:45,545
Watch, on the tree line!

886
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,379
What is it?

887
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:20,670
Come on!

888
01:17:21,879 --> 01:17:24,504
Run! Run!
