#<font color="#20e020">HI removed, cleaned

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,039
Clegane, look into the flames.

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,580
What do you see?

4
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,372
A wall of ice.

5
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,788
The Wall.

6
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,079
The only thing standing
between us

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,746
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

8
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:21,539
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

9
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,330
Last time we saw
The Night King,

10
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,372
it was at Hardhome.

11
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:27,621
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

12
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,372
And that's where I'll go.

13
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,205
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

14
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,581
This suits you, Lady Stark.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,997
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

16
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:55,039
- Lord Tarly.
- I believe you know my son.

17
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,705
Do you fight with us...

18
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:59,663
or with the fallen savages
and eunuchs?

19
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,038
What do you think I should do?

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,788
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

21
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:07,205
you're not different.

22
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:09,289
You're just more of the same.

23
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:12,456
Listen.

24
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:50,830
You could've killed me.

25
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,288
The fuck were you doing
back there?

26
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,580
Ending the war.

27
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,787
Killing her.

28
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,205
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

29
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:14,205
And?

30
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:22,787
Listen to me, cunt.

31
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,330
Till I get what I'm owed,

32
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,163
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

33
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:28,038
you don't
get to kill you,

34
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,497
only I get to kill you.

35
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:35,496
That was only
one of them.

36
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:38,330
She has two more.

37
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:41,413
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

38
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,038
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

39
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,038
No, I do not.

40
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,204
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

41
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,829
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

42
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,581
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

43
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,080
I have to tell Cersei.

44
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,872
May as well jump
back in that river.

45
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,204
I know what Cersei
has told you.

46
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:22,954
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

47
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:24,204
burn down your homes,

48
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,955
murder you,
and orphan your children.

49
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,580
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

50
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,787
I'm not here to murder,

51
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:36,538
and all I want to destroy

52
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,621
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

53
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:43,830
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

54
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,288
I offer you a choice...

55
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,621
bend the knee
and join me.

56
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,787
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

57
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,787
Or refuse...

58
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,289
and die.

59
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:28,830
Step forward, my lord.

60
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:39,954
You will not kneel?

61
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,331
I already have a queen.

62
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,038
My sister.

63
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,246
She wasn't your queen

64
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,288
until recently,
though, was she?

65
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,621
When she murdered
your rightful queen

66
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:52,246
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

67
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,539
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

68
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:59,580
There are
no easy choices in war.

69
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,954
Say what you will
about your sister,

70
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:04,455
she was born in Westeros.

71
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,705
She's lived here
all her life.

72
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,538
You, on the other hand,

73
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,288
murdered your own father

74
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,413
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

75
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,247
One with no ties
to this land...

76
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:24,247
with an army of savages
at her back.

77
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,913
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

78
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:31,371
I respect that.

79
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:34,413
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

80
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,829
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

81
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,079
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

82
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,414
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

83
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,414
You are not my queen.

84
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,204
You will have
to kill me, too.

85
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,080
Step back
and shut your mouth.

86
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,038
Who are you?

87
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,289
A stupid boy.

88
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,621
I am Dickon Tarly,

89
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:10,038
son of Randyll Tarly.

90
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,246
You are the future
of your house.

91
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,621
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

92
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,497
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

93
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,622
I will not.

94
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:34,662
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

95
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,246
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

96
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,912
I meant what I said.

97
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,455
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

98
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,787
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

99
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,164
I gave them a choice.

100
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,996
They made it.

101
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:50,163
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

102
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,331
I'm not beheading anyone.

103
00:09:57,705 --> 00:09:59,164
Your Grace.

104
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,038
Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

105
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,704
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

106
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,829
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

107
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,663
sentence you to die.

108
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:39,414
Dracarys.

109
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,955
My... my lord...

110
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,456
How many men did we lose?

111
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,080
We haven't done
a full accounting.

112
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:50,246
It's not only armies
that win wars.

113
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,746
We have the Tyrell gold, we
have the Iron Bank behind us.

114
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,414
We can buy mercenaries.

115
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,204
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

116
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,413
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

117
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:03,871
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

118
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,496
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

119
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,580
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

120
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,455
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

121
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,662
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

122
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,912
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

123
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:17,456
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

124
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,413
This isn't a war
we can win.

125
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,788
So, what do we do?

126
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,456
Sue for peace?

127
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,371
I sit on
her father's throne,

128
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,038
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

129
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,871
And in her mind,
she's winning.

130
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,955
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

131
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:41,829
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

132
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,205
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

133
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,455
He didn't.

134
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,455
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

135
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:51,330
I'm not talking
about Father.

136
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,871
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

137
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:58,164
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

138
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,872
She confessed
before she died.

139
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:07,413
And this was
before or after

140
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:10,496
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

141
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,121
After.

142
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,621
And you believed her?

143
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,371
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

144
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:19,039
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

145
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,787
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

146
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:25,330
Which one would have
made Olenna

147
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,038
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

148
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,913
She was telling
the truth.

149
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,497
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

150
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,079
She should have
died screaming.

151
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,371
She's dead, like her son,

152
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,455
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

153
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:50,038
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

154
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,580
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

155
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,746
I know my choice.

156
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:57,247
A soldier
should know his.

157
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,538
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

158
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,331
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

159
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,330
but, yes, they are.

160
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,829
Gorgeous beasts.

161
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,746
They're not beasts to me.

162
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,580
No matter
how big they get

163
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,746
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

164
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,372
they're my children.

165
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,371
You weren't gone long.

166
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,538
No.

167
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,538
And?

168
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,247
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

169
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,996
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

170
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,705
No, I'm not.

171
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:46,079
How many men
did your army kill

172
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

173
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,621
Thousands.

174
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,746
We both want
to help people.

175
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:56,455
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

176
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,539
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

177
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,413
When you first came here,

178
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:08,163
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

179
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,788
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

180
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,247
So, it was
a figure of speech?

181
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:34,622
Your Grace.

182
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,204
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

183
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:46,455
an old friend.

184
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,954
I served
with your father.

185
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,122
He was a great man.

186
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:53,331
You look strong.

187
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,496
You found a cure?

188
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,455
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

189
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:02,954
I return to your
service, my queen,

190
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,746
if you'll have me.

191
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:07,122
It would be my honor.

192
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,038
Ravens.

193
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,872
We need to send ravens.

194
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:55,079
I put very little stock
in it myself.

195
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,538
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

196
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,746
especially
when winter comes.

197
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:02,079
I remember Wolkan.

198
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,455
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

199
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:07,954
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

200
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:10,163
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

201
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,954
or the company.

202
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:14,121
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

203
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,246
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

204
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,413
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

205
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:21,079
Yes, it is a bit much.

206
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,788
Still, we ought to write
back... Brandon Stark.

207
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,456
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

208
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:33,787
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

209
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:36,954
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

210
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,538
And?

211
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,455
Somehow, a crippled boy

212
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,538
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

213
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,289
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

214
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,996
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

215
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:54,121
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

216
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,539
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

217
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:12,163
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

218
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:16,330
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

219
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,704
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

220
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,662
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

221
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:24,163
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

222
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,496
to search every word
of every faded scroll

223
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,288
about the Long Night,

224
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,121
they may find something
that lets us defeat

225
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,039
the Army of the Dead
for good.

226
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:38,331
It could be done.

227
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,538
And this news
could be authentic.

228
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,205
It's possible.

229
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,038
It's also possible
that this message

230
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,330
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

231
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:54,288
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

232
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,330
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

233
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,038
That does seem
far more likely

234
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,996
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

235
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,538
Archmaester, please.

236
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,705
It's real.

237
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:06,705
I've seen it.

238
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,038
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

239
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,413
at Winterfell
for clarification.

240
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:16,288
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

241
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,996
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

242
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:21,496
It brings to mind the work
of Jenny of Oldstones,

243
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:24,121
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

244
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,912
Don't forget
the prophet Lodos,

245
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,580
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

246
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,872
Ah, Lodos.

247
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:40,704
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

248
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:42,662
I'm afraid so.

249
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,912
Horrible business.

250
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,538
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

251
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,580
He's a good lad.

252
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,330
Right.

253
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:53,247
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

254
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:01,079
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

255
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,289
That's why
they're rulers.

256
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:07,413
She gave Tarly a choice,

257
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:10,246
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

258
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:11,996
What else could she do?

259
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:15,121
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

260
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:17,455
I am her Hand,
not her head.

261
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:19,704
I can't make
her decisions for her.

262
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,996
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

263
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:27,371
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

264
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,122
I was only a purveyor
of information.

265
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,330
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

266
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,912
I'm not the one doing it.

267
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:44,371
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

268
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,413
I'm not the one doing it.

269
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:47,996
When their hair
caught fire

270
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:50,871
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

271
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,497
I'm not the one doing it.

272
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:03,371
Daenerys is not
her father.

273
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,787
And she never will be

274
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:07,830
with the right counsel.

275
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,497
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

276
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,330
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

277
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,871
Did you read it?

278
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,913
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

279
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,497
What's it say?

280
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:34,164
Nothing good.

281
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:44,038
I thought Arya was dead.

282
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,121
I thought Bran was dead.

283
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:48,539
I'm happy for you.

284
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:52,330
You don't look happy.

285
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:54,704
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

286
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,705
marching towards
Eastwatch.

287
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,288
If they make it
past the Wall...

288
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,996
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

289
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:04,662
I need to go home.

290
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:06,371
You said you don't
have enough men.

291
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,954
We'll fight
with the men we have.

292
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,580
Unless you'll join us.

293
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,746
And give the country
to Cersei?

294
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:16,580
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

295
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,912
Perhaps not.

296
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:22,330
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

297
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:25,580
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

298
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,330
What if we
prove her wrong?

299
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:30,747
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

300
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,080
So bring the dead to her.

301
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,413
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

302
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:39,787
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

303
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,829
Only one soldier.

304
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,747
Is that possible?

305
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,288
The first wight
I ever saw

306
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,121
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

307
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:54,455
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

308
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,746
and show her the truth.

309
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,787
Anything you bring back
will be useless

310
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:00,621
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

311
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,163
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

312
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:05,413
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

313
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:08,996
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

314
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,830
He might listen to me.

315
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,663
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

316
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,662
I can smuggle you in,

317
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,288
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

318
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,496
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

319
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:31,912
Well, it will all
be for nothing

320
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,704
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

321
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:35,079
Fair point.

322
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,372
How do you propose
to find one?

323
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:42,997
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

324
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:48,038
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

325
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,663
Allow me to serve you.

326
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,163
The Free Folk
will help us.

327
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,912
They know the real north
better than anyone.

328
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,455
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

329
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,663
They won't have to.

330
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:10,121
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

331
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:12,746
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

332
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,330
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

333
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,705
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

334
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

335
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:27,288
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

336
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,497
I am a king.

337
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,538
And I came here

338
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,371
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

339
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:36,580
or your dragons
burn me alive.

340
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:40,996
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

341
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:43,996
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

342
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,164
for all our people.

343
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:52,039
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

344
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:56,247
because it's
our best chance.

345
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:18,581
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

346
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:25,496
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

347
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,331
But perhaps
we should have.

348
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,621
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

349
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:37,080
Aye.

350
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,954
You are very kind,
my lords.

351
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,996
But Jon is our king.

352
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:49,539
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

353
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,496
I warned Jon
this would happen.

354
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,163
That he couldn't
leave the North

355
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:05,996
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

356
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,371
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

357
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,164
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

358
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,121
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

359
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:19,663
And?

360
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,704
Nothing.

361
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:27,496
Don't do that.

362
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:29,997
- What?
- Say what you mean.

363
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,122
You always liked
nice things.

364
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,830
They made you feel
better than everyone.

365
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,330
Are you angry with me?

366
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:46,662
They were insulting Jon,

367
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:48,038
and you sat there
and listened.

368
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,538
I listened
to their complaints,

369
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:52,580
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

370
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:55,538
Their opinions
are important to you.

371
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,246
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

372
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,204
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

373
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,205
Not if they lose
their heads first.

374
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:09,829
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

375
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,704
We took it back,

376
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,662
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

377
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:15,121
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

378
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,662
All of us,
working together.

379
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:20,996
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

380
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:24,539
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

381
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,996
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

382
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,954
you'll need
their support...

383
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,079
so you can work together

384
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,038
to give you
what you really want.

385
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,622
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

386
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,372
You're thinking it
right now.

387
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:48,330
You don't want to be,

388
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:50,622
but the thought
just won't go away.

389
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,414
I have work to do.

390
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,372
My lady.

391
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,662
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

392
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:21,622
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

393
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:27,621
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

394
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:30,288
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

395
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,663
Too many steps.

396
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,829
You're not staying here?

397
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,330
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

398
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,163
What if someone
takes the boat?

399
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,456
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

400
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:52,288
We don't have time
for this.

401
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:54,455
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

402
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,621
The Dothraki are coming.

403
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,746
All the more reason
for you to train.

404
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,746
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

405
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:02,288
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

406
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,288
And here I am,
ready to train.

407
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,246
Why down here?

408
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:08,079
I don't think
you want people to see

409
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,996
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

410
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:13,787
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

411
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:16,331
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

412
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,205
I'll leave you to it.

413
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,331
I needed to see you.

414
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:34,622
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

415
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,121
You made me look
like a complete fool.

416
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:43,413
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

417
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:46,371
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

418
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:48,954
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

419
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:50,455
Father would have
been proud.

420
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:52,204
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

421
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,704
I once told Bronn

422
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,539
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

423
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,039
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

424
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,121
He was going
to execute me.

425
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:15,829
He knew I was innocent.

426
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,163
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

427
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,538
he hated me
because of what I am.

428
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,705
A little monster
sent to punish him.

429
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:27,787
Did he...
did he think...

430
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,580
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

431
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:31,501
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

432
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:39,539
Daenerys will
win this war.

433
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,330
You're a military man.

434
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:46,080
You must know there's
no way around that.

435
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:49,704
Daenerys
is not her father.

436
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:52,580
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

437
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:55,080
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

438
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:57,621
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

439
00:33:57,622 --> 00:33:59,079
you can ask her yourself.

440
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,456
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

441
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:04,581
Not right now, anyway.

442
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:08,997
She has a more
important request.

443
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:50,705
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

444
00:34:57,997 --> 00:34:59,997
Thought you might
still be rowing.

445
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:06,704
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

446
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,996
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

447
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:12,496
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

448
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:13,912
Haven't been here
in years.

449
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,330
Why should
they recognize me?

450
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,997
Sometimes I hardly do.

451
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:22,830
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

452
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:29,704
Anybody give you
any trouble?

453
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:32,163
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

454
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,038
and I never get
a second look.

455
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,538
But you were right.

456
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:38,079
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

457
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,580
Don't be so sure.

458
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:42,497
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

459
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,247
Bad things are coming.

460
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,704
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

461
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,829
- Well, the thing you need to understand is...
- I'm ready.

462
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,288
- You...
- Let's go.

463
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:57,204
You should know
what you're heading into.

464
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:59,204
What do you think
I've been thinking about

465
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:00,580
with every swing
of the hammer?

466
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:03,038
How happy I am
making weapons

467
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,496
for the family
that killed my father?

468
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,205
The family that
tried to kill me?

469
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,580
I've been getting ready.

470
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,038
I never knew what for,

471
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,581
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

472
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,330
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

473
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:22,247
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

474
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,080
But this...

475
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,247
this I know.

476
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:38,746
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

477
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:41,539
Situation's complicated
enough already.

478
00:36:42,913 --> 00:36:44,581
Well, who should
I say I am?

479
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,829
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

480
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,331
- someone's going to...
- You there!

481
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:57,289
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

482
00:36:58,497 --> 00:36:59,954
What can I do for you?

483
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:02,455
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

484
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,871
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

485
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,371
I try to stay
away from them

486
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,622
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

487
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:14,621
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

488
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:16,871
You must be even older
than you look.

489
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,787
- 15.
- 15?!

490
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:19,913
Apiece.

491
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,456
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

492
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,331
What's in the boat?

493
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:41,038
Not more gold.

494
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,787
- Wine?
- Mm.

495
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,788
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

496
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:47,830
Come have a look.

497
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:58,288
- Fermented crab.
- What?

498
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,163
Fermented crab.

499
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:03,163
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

500
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,121
A man thinks he's done.

501
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:07,704
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

502
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:09,621
But before he gets
his breeches up,

503
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:12,996
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

504
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:16,538
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

505
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:19,039
Here, have a taste.

506
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,580
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

507
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,080
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

508
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Oi, dwarf!

509
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:07,954
I really wouldn't
try any more

510
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,996
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

511
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,871
That dwarf...

512
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,496
Where'd you get
that scar?

513
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:16,038
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

514
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,121
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

515
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:21,164
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

516
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,538
Arrangement?

517
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:28,747
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

518
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:38,288
This is Gendry.

519
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,788
He'll do.

520
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,497
Go, go, go.

521
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,787
I could give you something.

522
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,289
That won't be necessary.

523
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:58,830
Ser Jaime.

524
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:04,456
Why was Qyburn here?

525
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:08,122
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

526
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:15,331
I met with Tyrion.

527
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:25,955
What did our brother
have to say?

528
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,996
Daenerys wants to meet.

529
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:33,621
To discuss her surrender?

530
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,455
To discuss an armistice.

531
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:38,246
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

532
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,996
Because an army
of dead men

533
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:42,539
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

534
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,872
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

535
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:53,121
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

536
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,622
Bronn.

537
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,538
He betrayed you.

538
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,913
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

539
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,038
Do you think
anything of importance

540
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,538
happens in this city
without me knowing?

541
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,787
You let it happen.
Why?

542
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:15,455
I've come to believe that

543
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,163
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

544
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,704
could be in our
immediate interest.

545
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:24,038
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

546
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,205
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

547
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:32,830
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

548
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:37,871
Whatever stands
in our way,

549
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,621
we will defeat it.

550
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,413
For ourselves,
for our house,

551
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:44,414
for this.

552
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,621
Who will you say
is the father?

553
00:41:58,622 --> 00:41:59,913
You.

554
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,080
People won't like that.

555
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:15,121
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

556
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:19,080
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

557
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:34,955
Never betray me again.

558
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,954
We're leaving today.

559
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:45,538
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

560
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:48,121
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

561
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:50,580
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

562
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,912
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

563
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:55,912
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

564
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,913
Understood.

565
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,538
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

566
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:02,996
You survived
King's Landing.

567
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,996
Yet again. Your
Grace, this is Clo...

568
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,413
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

569
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:09,996
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

570
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:11,122
Bastard son.

571
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:16,662
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

572
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:18,496
Our fathers
trusted each other.

573
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:19,830
Why shouldn't we?

574
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:24,621
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

575
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:27,830
I met yours in my shop.

576
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,872
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

577
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,746
I grew up on
stories about them.

578
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:48,747
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

579
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:53,288
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

580
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:55,079
Let me come with you.

581
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,954
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

582
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:58,787
No, but I'm a fighter.

583
00:43:58,788 --> 00:44:01,872
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

584
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:05,787
You know how to use one?

585
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:08,163
Well, that's a problem.

586
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:09,705
I prefer a hammer.

587
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,414
He can handle himself.

588
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:18,288
We could use the help.

589
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,163
As my father used to say,

590
00:44:20,164 --> 00:44:22,246
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

591
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:24,496
than dead for
the rest of your life."

592
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,912
I owe you my life.

593
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:28,704
Twice over.

594
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:31,954
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

595
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:34,414
I can't wait out
this war.

596
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:40,121
Yeah, nobody mind me.

597
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:44,163
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

598
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:46,080
All right, come on.

599
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,912
You may not believe it,

600
00:44:57,913 --> 00:45:00,621
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

601
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:03,746
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

602
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:05,039
Not even Grey Worm.

603
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,787
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

604
00:45:12,788 --> 00:45:15,787
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

605
00:45:15,788 --> 00:45:19,622
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

606
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,456
Take it with you.

607
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:29,621
But bring it back.

608
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:30,788
Our queen needs you.

609
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:42,622
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

610
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:45,788
Your Grace, I...

611
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:05,455
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

612
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,816
with the King
in the North anymore.

613
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:10,997
I've grown used to him.

614
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,705
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

615
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:26,456
Heave!

616
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:54,038
Do you know how many steps
there are in the Citadel?

617
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,246
No.

618
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:58,205
15,782.

619
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:06,205
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

620
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:10,871
None anymore.

621
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,538
That's true.

622
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,871
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

623
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:19,080
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

624
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,829
What does
"annulment" mean?

625
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,704
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

626
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:35,079
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

627
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,580
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

628
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:41,121
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

629
00:47:41,122 --> 00:47:43,038
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

630
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:44,414
These maesters...

631
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:49,871
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

632
00:47:49,872 --> 00:47:52,163
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

633
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:53,954
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

634
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,621
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

635
00:47:56,622 --> 00:47:58,538
But that's all right,
isn't it?

636
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:02,621
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

637
00:48:02,622 --> 00:48:04,246
as long as we can have access
to the full records

638
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:08,289
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

639
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:12,247
Steps.

640
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:17,414
That number
was the steps.

641
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:41,954
Are you sure
you want to do this?

642
00:49:41,955 --> 00:49:44,372
You always wanted
to be a maester.

643
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:50,164
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

644
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:21,122
I found it, my lord.

645
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,538
It, uh, took
some searching.

646
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:28,622
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

647
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,954
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

648
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:37,830
Uh, yes, my lord.

649
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:44,539
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

650
00:54:16,663 --> 00:54:18,538
Isn't it your job
to talk him out

651
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:20,538
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

652
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:23,331
I've been failing
at that job of late.

653
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:26,996
How many queens
are there now?

654
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,330
Two.

655
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,496
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

656
00:54:31,497 --> 00:54:33,331
or the one who
fucks her brother?

657
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:36,163
Both.

658
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:38,205
How many men
did you bring?

659
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:42,829
Not enough.

660
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,456
The big woman?

661
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,580
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

662
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:53,413
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

663
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:56,538
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

664
00:54:56,539 --> 00:54:57,539
You are.

665
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:03,539
You really want to go out there?
Again?

666
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,581
You're not the only ones.

667
00:55:15,205 --> 00:55:18,704
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

668
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:20,581
Said they were
on their way here.

669
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:28,872
You're the Hound.

670
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:32,705
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

671
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,580
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

672
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:43,871
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

673
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:46,038
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

674
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,246
Don't trust him.

675
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:50,205
Don't trust any of them.

676
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,455
They're the Brotherhood.

677
00:55:57,456 --> 00:56:00,038
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

678
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:02,413
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

679
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:04,122
Thoros?

680
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,246
I hardly recognized you.

681
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:13,455
Ser Jorah Mormont.

682
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:16,413
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

683
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,455
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

684
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:22,288
You're a fucking Mormont?

685
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:24,413
Like the last
Lord Commander?

686
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,621
He was my father.

687
00:56:26,622 --> 00:56:29,621
He hunted us
like animals.

688
00:56:29,622 --> 00:56:32,663
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

689
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:36,954
Here we all are

690
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:38,538
at the edge of the world

691
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:40,121
at the same moment,

692
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:42,622
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

693
00:56:44,456 --> 00:56:46,704
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

694
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:49,080
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

695
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:53,079
There's a greater
purpose at work.

696
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,371
And we serve it together,

697
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,662
whether we
know it or not.

698
00:56:58,663 --> 00:57:01,580
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

699
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:04,954
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

700
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,746
Are we coming
with you or not?

701
00:57:07,747 --> 00:57:09,954
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

702
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:14,371
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

703
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:16,371
He's right.

704
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:18,372
We're all
on the same side.

705
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:21,997
How can we be?

706
00:57:23,622 --> 00:57:25,705
We're all breathing.

707
00:59:58,497 --> 01:00:00,205
Death is the enemy.

708
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:07,622
The first enemy and the last.

709
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,414
The enemy always wins.

710
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:17,872
And we still need to fight him.

711
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,497
You're scared, aren't you?

712
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,331
What are you scared of?
